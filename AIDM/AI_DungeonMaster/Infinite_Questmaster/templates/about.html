                Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) have always been about shared storytelling and imaginative adventures. Players create characters and embark on quests guided by a game master who sets the scene and reacts to their choices. However, being a game master can be challenging, requiring creativity and quick thinking to keep the story engaging. With the rise of AI technology, there's an opportunity to lighten the load on game masters by using AI to help with storytelling.
